Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance Lyrics[Verse 1]
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you
Well, I’m a-walking down the road with my head in my hand
I’m looking for a woman needs a worried man
Just a-one kind favor I ask of you, allow me just a-one more chance

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your airplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train
Well, I’ve been looking all over for a girl like you
I can’t find no better so you’ll have to do
There's just a-one kind favor I ask of you, allow me just a-one more chance

[Instrumental Break]
Woo-hoo

[Verse 3]
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
I's just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand
Just a-one kind favor I ask you, allow me just a-one more chance
