Ballad of a Thin Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home

[Refrain]
Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 2]
You raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Well, what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God, am I here all alone?"

[Refrain]
But something is happening
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
