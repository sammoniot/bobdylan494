TranslationsEspañolLike a Rolling Stone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware, doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"
