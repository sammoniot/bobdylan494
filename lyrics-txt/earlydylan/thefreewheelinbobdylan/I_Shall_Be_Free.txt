I Shall Be Free Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I took me a woman late last night
I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked alright
'Til she started peeling off her onion gook
Took off her wig, said, “How do I look?"
I's high-flying, bare-naked
Out the window

[Verse 2]
Well, sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
Don’t hurt me none, it don’t hurt my pride
Because I got my little lady right by my side
She's a-tryin' to hide, pretendin' she don't know me

[Verse 3]
I’s out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can of black paint, it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
Cost a quarter
Half-price

[Verse 4]
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop
It’s President Kennedy calling me up
He said, “My friend, Bob
What do we need to make the country grow?”
I said, “My friend, John; Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren”
Country'll grow
