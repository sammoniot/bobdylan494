Bob Dylan’s Blues Lyrics[Intro]
Unlike most of the songs nowadays that are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley, that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this, this is a song, this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States

[Verse 1]
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are riding down the line
Fixing everybody’s troubles
Everybody’s except mine
Somebody must have told them
That I was doing fine

[Verse 2]
Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothing in your heads
I got a real gal I’m loving
And Lord I’ll love her till I’m dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now

[Verse 3]
Lord, I ain't going down to no race track
See no sports car run
I don’t have no sports car
And I don’t even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block
