Corrina, Corrina Lyrics[Verse 1]
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, where you been so long?
I've been worrying about you, baby
Baby, please come home

[Verse 2]
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But I ain't a-got Corrina
Life don't mean a thing

[Verse 3]
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're on my mind
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're on my mind
I'm a-sittin' down thinkin' of you
I just can't keep from cryin'3Embed
[Verse 1]
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, where you been so long?
I've been worrying about you, baby
Baby, please come home

[Verse 2]
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But I ain't a-got Corrina
Life don't mean a thing

[Verse 3]
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're on my mind
Corrina, Corrina
Gal, you're on my mind
I'm a-sittin' down thinkin' of you
I just can't keep from cryin'
