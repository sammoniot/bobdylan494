Highway 61 Revisited Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
Abe said, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God say, "No."
Abe say, "What?"
God say, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killin' done?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61"

[Verse 2]
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department, they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There’s only one place I know"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man, I got to run"
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, "That way, down Highway 61"

[Verse 3]
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son"
And he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done!
Just take everything down to Highway 61"
