Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't want to judge nobody, don't want to be judged
Don't want to touch nobody, don't want to be touched
Don't want to hurt nobody, don't want to be hurt
Don't want to treat nobody like they was dirt

[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

[Verse 2]
Don't want to shoot nobody, don't want to be shot
Don't want to buy nobody, don't want to be bought
Don't want to bury nobody, don't want to be buried
Don't want to marry nobody if they're already married

[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I'll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you'd have them, like you'd have them do unto you

[Verse 3]
Don't want to burn nobody, don't want to be burned
Don't want to learn from nobody what I got to unlearn
Don't want to cheat nobody, don't want to be cheated
Don't want to defeat nobody if they already been defeated
