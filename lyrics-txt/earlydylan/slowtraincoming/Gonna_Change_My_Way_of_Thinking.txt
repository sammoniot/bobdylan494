Gonna Change My Way of Thinking Lyrics[Verse 1]
Change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Gonna change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Going to put my good foot forward
Stop being influenced by fools

[Verse 2]
So much oppression
Can't keep track of it no more
So much oppression
Can't keep track of it no more
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
Old men turning young daughters into whores

[Verse 3]
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Swords piercing your side
Blood and water flowing through the land

[Verse 4]
Well, I don't know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Don't know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or being cool
You remember only about the brass ring
You forget all about the golden rule
