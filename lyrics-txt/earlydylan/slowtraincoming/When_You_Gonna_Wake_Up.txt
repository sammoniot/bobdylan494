When You Gonna Wake Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
God don’t make promises that He don’t keep
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep

[Chorus]
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 2]
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots

[Chorus]
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 3]
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills

[Chorus]
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
When you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 4]
You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
