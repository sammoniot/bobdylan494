License to Kill Lyrics[Verse 1]
Man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don’t change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon

[Refrain]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 2]
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars

[Refrain]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sits there facing the hill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 3]
Now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies
