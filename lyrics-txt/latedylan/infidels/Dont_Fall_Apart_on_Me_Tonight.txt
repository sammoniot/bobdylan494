Don’t Fall Apart on Me Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Who’ve lost all ray of hope
You know, it's not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope
[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here, you can have my chair
I can’t see us goin' anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I can’t take you there
I wished I’d have been a doctor
Maybe I’d have saved some life that've been lost
Maybe I’d have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed
