I and I Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 2]
Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
Not much happening here, nothing ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
I got nothing to say, specially about whatever was

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 3]
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
