When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look out across the fields, see me returning
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You’ve had time to think about it for a while

[Verse 2]
Well, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over
It’s the end of the chase and the moon is high
It won’t matter who loves who
You’ll love me or I’ll love you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 3]
I can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that you’ve been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape

[Verse 4]
Well, I can’t provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You’ll know all about it, love
It’ll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky
