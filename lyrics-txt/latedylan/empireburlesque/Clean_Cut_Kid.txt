Clean Cut Kid Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know why he couldn’t adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 2]
They said what’s up is down, they said what isn’t is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 3]
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did
