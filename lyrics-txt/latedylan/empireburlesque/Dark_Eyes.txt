Dark Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And the midnight moon is on the riverside
They're drinking up and walking
And it is time for me to slide
I live in another world
Where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 2]
A cock is crowing far away
And another soldier's deep in prayer
Some mother's child has gone astray
She can't find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum
Beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature's beast fears as they come
And all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 3]
They tell me to be discreet
For all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet
And from where they stand, I'm sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game
Where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame
And all I see are dark eyes
[Verse 4]
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
And a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price
To the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
And passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet
But all I see are dark eyes
