Seeing the Real You at Last Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
But it looks like it don’t
I’d like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you won’t

[Verse 2]
From now on I’ll be busy
I am not going to nowhere fast
I’m just glad it’s over
And I’m seeing the real you at last

[Verse 3]
Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you
Didn’t I take chances?
Didn’t I rise above it all for you
The most unfortunate circumstances?

[Verse 4]
Well, I have had some rotten nights
Didn’t think that they would pass
I’m just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last

[Verse 5]
I’m hungry and I’m irritable
And I’m tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix
