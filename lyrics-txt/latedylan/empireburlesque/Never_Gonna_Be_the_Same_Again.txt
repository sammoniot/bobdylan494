Never Gonna Be the Same Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now you’re here beside me, baby
You’re a living dream
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I hurt you, baby
Sorry if I did
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 3]
You give me something to think about, baby
Every time I see you
Don’t worry, baby, I don’t mind leaving
I’d just like it to be my idea

[Verse 4]
You taught me how to love you, baby
You taught me, oh, so well
Now, I can’t go back to what was, baby
I can’t unring the bell
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I am not going to be the same againEmbed
[Verse 1]
Now you’re here beside me, baby
You’re a living dream
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I hurt you, baby
Sorry if I did
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 3]
You give me something to think about, baby
Every time I see you
Don’t worry, baby, I don’t mind leaving
I’d just like it to be my idea

[Verse 4]
You taught me how to love you, baby
You taught me, oh, so well
Now, I can’t go back to what was, baby
I can’t unring the bell
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I am not going to be the same again
