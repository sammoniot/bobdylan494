Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anyone Seen My Love) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn’t with you around my neck
I said I’d send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven’t even started yet
I’ll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
I’ll remember to forget

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I’m going to get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
There’s something I’ve got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

[Chorus]
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don’t know
Has anybody seen my love?
