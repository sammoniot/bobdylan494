Love Sick Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

[Verse 2]
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

[Chorus 1]
I’m sick of love
But I'm in the thick of it
This kind of love
I'm so sick of it

[Verse 3]
I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

[Chorus 2]
I'm sick of love
I hear the clock tick
This kind of love
I'm lovesick
[Verse 4]
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

[Chorus 3]
I'm sick of love
I wish I'd never met you
I'm sick of love
I'm trying to forget you

[Outro]
Just don’t know what to do
I'd give anything to be with you2Embed
[Verse 1]
I'm walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

[Verse 2]
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

[Chorus 1]
I’m sick of love
But I'm in the thick of it
This kind of love
I'm so sick of it

[Verse 3]
I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

[Chorus 2]
I'm sick of love
I hear the clock tick
This kind of love
I'm lovesick

[Verse 4]
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

[Chorus 3]
I'm sick of love
I wish I'd never met you
I'm sick of love
I'm trying to forget you

[Outro]
Just don’t know what to do
I'd give anything to be with you
