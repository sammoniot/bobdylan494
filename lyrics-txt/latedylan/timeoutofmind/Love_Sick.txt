Love Sick Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

[Verse 2]
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

[Chorus 1]
Iâ€™m sick of love
But I'm in the thick of it
This kind of love
I'm so sick of it

[Verse 3]
I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

[Chorus 2]
I'm sick of love
I hear the clock tick
This kind of love
I'm lovesick
