Million Miles Lyrics[Verse 1]
You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 2]
You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 3]
I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 4]
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 5]
Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
[Verse 6]
The last thing you said before you hit the street
“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
I said, “That’s all right mama you  you do what you gotta do”
Well, I’m trying to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 7]
Rock me, pretty baby; rock me ’till everything gets real
Rock me for a little while; rock me ’till there’s nothing left to feel
And I’ll rock you too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 8]
Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
Yes, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from youEmbed
[Verse 1]
You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 2]
You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 3]
I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 4]
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

[Verse 5]
Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
