Not Dark Yet Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shadows are fallin' and I've been here all day
It's too hot to sleep and time is runnin' away
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal

[Chorus]
There's not even room enough to be anywhere
It's not dark yet, but it's gettin' there

[Verse 2]
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writin' what was in her mind

[Chorus]
I just don't see why I should even care
It's not dark yet, but it's gettin' there

[Verse 3]
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris
I've followed the river and I got to the sea
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
I ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyoneâ€™s eyes
