Highlands Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, my heart's in the Highlands gentle and fair
Honeysuckle bloomin' in the Wildwood air
Bluebells blazin' where the Aberdeen waters flow
Well my heart's in the Highlands
I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

[Verse 2]
Windows was shakin' all night in my dreams
Everything was exactly the way that it seems
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page
Same ol' rat race
Life in the same ol' cage

[Verse 3]
I don't want nothin' from anyone, ain't that much to take
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
I wish someone would come
And push back the clock for me

[Verse 4]
Well my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam
That's where I'll be when I get called home
The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
Well my heart's in the Highlands
I can only get there one step at a time
