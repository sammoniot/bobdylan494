10 ContributorsDirt Road Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gon' walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
Gon' walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
If I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide

[Verse 2]
Well, I've have been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Well, I have been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack

[Verse 3]
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
’Til there’s nothing left to see, ’til the chains have been shattered
And I’ve been freed

[Verse 4]
But I've been looking at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow, watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love

[Interlude]

[Verse 5]
Gon' walk on down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Gon' walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Well, I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my nameSee Bob Dylan LiveGet tickets as low as $175You might also likeEmbed
