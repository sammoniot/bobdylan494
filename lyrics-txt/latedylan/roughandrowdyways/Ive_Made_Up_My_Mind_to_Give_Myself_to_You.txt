Ive Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You Lyrics [Verse 1]I'm sittin' on my terrace, lost in the stars
Listening to the sounds of the sadguitars
Beenthinking it allover and I've thought it allthrough
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
[Verse 2]
I saw the first fall ofsnow
I saw the flowers come and go
I don't think that anyone ever else ever knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
[Verse 3]
I'm giving myself to you, I am
From Salt Lake City to Birmingham
From East L.A. to San Antone
I don't think I can bear to live my life alone
[Verse 4]
My eye is like a shooting star
It looks at nothin' here or there, looks at nothin' near or far
No one ever told me, it's just something I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
[Verse 5]
If I had the wings of a snow white dove
I'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love
A love so real, a love so true
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
[Verse 6]
Take me out traveling, you're a traveling man
Show me something I don't understand
I'm not what I was, things aren't what they were
I'll go far away from home with her
I traveled a long road of despair
I met no other traveler there
Lot of people gone, lot of people I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
[Verse 7]
Well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
Just takes me a while to realize things
I'll see you at sunrise, I'll see you at dawn
I'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone
[Verse 8]
I've traveled from the mountains to the sea
I hope that the gods go easy with me
I knew you'd say yes, I'm saying it too
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
