            <h1>My Methods to Finding Data</h1>
            <p>For this analysis,I use Python for the webscraping and consult two main sources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Bob-dylan" target="blank">Genius</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://bobdylan.fandom.com/wiki/Discography" target="blank">Bob Dylan
                        Discography</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <section class="sub">
                <h2>Data</h2>
                <p>I used several platforms to acquire the data necessary for this project. Click <a
                        href="methods.html" target="blank">here</a> to learn more about them. I
                    organized the data with excel,tsv and csv files.Click here to view my data
                    files. Additionally,I used advanced excel features such as VLOOKUP,COUNTIF,Pivot
                    Tables and other functions to clean,organize and complile data. </p>
                <h4>Problems</h4> There were various problems that occured as I worked on this
                project. First,when attempting to retrieve data from Genius,The files with lyrics
                would repeat and/or include special characters in place of apostrophes. I fixed
                these issues by using regex to find the end of the song which had the text"Embed" at
                the end before repeating and then deleting the repeating lines.I also used find and
                replace to change the special characters to apostrophes. Another issue was that
                Genius did not have as much data as I would have liked. I was able to get album
                name,track count and release years but I was unable to get additional information
                such as genre,instruments and other potentially relevant data. In a meeting with
                Dr.B,we found a Bob Dylan wiki page that was created a run by Dylan fans. This site
                gave me relevant data such as genre,instrumentation,format and more. This solved the
                problem and I was able to get more data as a result. A third issue was that various
                excel functions like VLOOKUP do not work on tsv or csv files so I had to make a copy
                of the data in an excel spreadsheet that would be compatible with excel
                spreadsheets.For part of my analysis,I wanted to find the total number of verses
                over 8 albums. 4 in Dylan's early years and 4 in his late years. Most of the song
                txt files that I got via webscraping Genuis had verses tagged but some did not.
                Since I was familiar with most of the songs,like Queen Jane Approximately,I was able
                to figure out how many verses there were and added them myself.</section>
            <section class="sub">
                <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                <p>I created multiple .py files to output tsv and csv files to organize my data.
                    Then,I made sure that the variables like Album names were consistent across the
                    files so that I could use the "VLOOKUP function. If the album title was slightly
                    different in one file,the VLOOKUP function would not work. For example,if there
                    was an extra space in the title "Bob Dylan" like this: " Bob Dylan" or there was
                    a typo,the function cannot match the data to the other table. I used the COUNTIF
                    function to determine which period the album belongs to. Then,after compiling
                    and cleaning data,I would use pivot tables to filter data. "I normally filter by
                    period which is either early or late dylan.In the rows column I would put a
                    variable like format and the count of format. The table would read that Early
                    Dylan had a count of 17 vinyl which would mean that all 17 albums were released
                    on vinyl.If you would like to download my files,you may do so by clicking these
