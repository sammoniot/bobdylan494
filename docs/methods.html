        <h1>My Methods to Finding Data</h1>
        <p>For this analysis,I use Python for the webscraping and consult two main sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Genius</li>
            <li>Bob Dylan Discography</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Questions</h2>
        <p>There are a few questions that I plan on answering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is Dylan's production rate over the years?Has he released more original albums
                during his earlier or later years?</li>
            <li>What themes does he mention most in songs?</li>
            <li>How many different genres does he dabble in?Does he mostly stick with one genre?</li>
            <li>How many songs has he written?</li>
        </ul>
