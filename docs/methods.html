        <section><h1>My Methods to Finding Data</h1>
        <p>For this analysis,I use Python for the webscraping and consult two main sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Bob-dylan" target="blank">Genius</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://bobdylan.fandom.com/wiki/Discography" target="blank">Bob Dylan
                    Discography</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
       <section class="sub"> <h2>My Questions</h2>
        <p>There are a few questions that I plan on answering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is Dylan's production rate over the years?Has he released more original albums
                during his earlier or later years?</li>
            <li>What themes does he mention most in songs?</li>
            <li>How many different genres does he dabble in?Does he mostly stick with one
                genre?</li>
            <li>How many songs has he written?</li>
        </ul></section>
       <section class="sub"> <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>I created multiple .py files to output tsv and csv files to organize my data. Then,I made
            sure that the variables like Album names were consistent across the files so that I
            could use the "VLOOKUP function. If the album title was slightly different in one
            file,the VLOOKUP function would not work. For example,if there was an extra space in the
            title "Bob Dylan" like this: " Bob Dylan" or there was a typo,the function cannot match
            the data to th"e other table. I used the COUNTIF function to determine which period the
            album belongs to. Then,after compiling and cleaning data,I would use pivot tables to
            filter data. "I normally filter by period which is either early or late dylan.In the rows
            column I would put a variable like format and the count of format. The table would read
            that Early Dylan had a count of 17 vinyl which would mean that all 17 albums were

            <h2>Visualizations</h2>
    
        <p>The visualizations you see on the album analysis and media format pages are made with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Power BI</li>
            <li>Kumu.io</li>
            <li>AntConc</li>
