            <p>Bob Dylan has created original musical content from 1962 to 2020. Over the
                years,Dylan has created music spanning many different genres. Since 1962, he has
                released 33 original studio albums and released them on different formats.Take a

                    <p> Here are my svgs that I made to show which formats Dylan released music on. </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="format" src="format.svg"
                            alt="funnel graph that displays which formats Dylan released music on" />
                        <figcaption>This funnel graph analyzes the formats all original and early
                            Dylan albums were released on.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The more recent the format is,the less albums are released on them. This
                        makes sense because as more formats were becoming popularized,Dylan shifted
                        towards releasing his music on newer platforms.Although,Dylan continued to
                        stay loyal to vinyl.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="format" src="lateformat.svg"
                            alt="funnel graph of late Dylan formats" />
                        <figcaption>This funnel graph analyzes the formats all original and late
                            Dylan albums were released on.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Dylan continued his trend of releasing fewer albums on older formats but
                        still released all of his albums on vinyl. He also releases his albums on
                        more platforms than in his early career. </p>
