        <h1>A Little About This Project</h1>
        <p>My goal with this project is to analyze the lyrics of Bob Dylan albums over the years. I
            will analyze five Bob Dylan albums:The Freewhiln' Bob Dylan (1963),Highway 61
            Revisited(1965),Blood on the Tracks (1975),Slow Trains a Coming (1979) and finally Rough
            and Rowdy (2020).I will create data visualizations that accurately reflect patterns and
            effectively demonstrate common or consistent themes across his work.</p>
