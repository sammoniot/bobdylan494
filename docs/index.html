        <h1 class="h1">Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Bob Dylan Analysis!On this site we will explore various aspects of Bob
            Dylan's career. This is primarily a data analysis and visualization project. The <a
                href="methods.html" target="blank">methods page</a> will focus on how and where I
            retrieved data from and the <a href="viz.html" target="blank">visualization page</a>
            will focus on the results and findings of my data analysis. If you would like to know
            more about me,check out my <a href="about.html" target="blank">about me page</a>. The
            project primarily focuses on Dylan's original albums. For this project,I categorize an
            original album as an album that consists primarily of songs that were written by Dylan
            himself.Primarily we will be discussing his original albums. Overall,there are 33
            original albums and a total of 48 live or compilation albums. I consider albums that are
            covers such as Shadows of the Night as compilation albums.Additionally,I also make a
            distinction from his early years and late years. I define his early years from 1962-1980
            and his late years from 1980-2020. Although this may seem uneven,there are 17 original
            albums from his early years and 16 from his late years.</p>
        <h2>Music History</h2>
        <p>Bob Dylan has created original musical content from 1962 to 2020. Over the years,Dylan
            has created music spanning many different genres. Since 1962, he has released 33
            original studio albums and released them on different formats.Take a look at my

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>I used several platforms to acquire the data necessary for this project. Click <a
                href="methods.html" target="blank">here</a> to learn more about them. I organized
            the data with excel,tsv and csv files.Click here to view my data files. Additionally,I
            used advanced excel features such as VLOOKUP,COUNTIF,Pivot Tables and other functions to
            clean,organize and complile data. </p>
        <h4>Problems</h4> There were various problems that occured as I worked on this project.
        First,when attempting to retrieve data from Genius,The files with lyrics would repeat and/or
        include special characters in place of apostrophes. I fixed these issues by using regex to
        find the end of the song which had the text"Embed" at the end before repeating and then
        deleting the repeating lines.I also used find and replace to change the special characters
        to apostrophes. Another issue was that Genius did not have as much data as I would have
        liked. I was able to get album name,track count and release years but I was unable to get
        additional information such as genre,instruments and other potentially relevant data. In a
        meeting with Dr.B,we found a Bob Dylan wiki page that was created a run by Dylan fans. This
        site gave me relevant data such as genre,instrumentation,format and more. This solved the
        problem and I was able to get more data as a result. A third issue was that various excel
        functions like VLOOKUP do not work on tsv or csv files so I had to make a copy of the data
        in an excel spreadsheet that would be compatible with excel spreadsheets.For part of my
        analysis,I wanted to find the total number of verses over 8 albums. 4 in Dylan's early years
        and 4 in his late years. Most of the song txt files that I got via webscraping Genuis had
        verses tagged but some did not. Since I was familiar with most of the songs,like Queen Jane
        Approximately,I was able to figure out how many verses there were and added them myself.<section>
