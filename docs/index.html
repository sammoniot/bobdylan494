            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Bob Dylan Analysis!On this site we will explore various aspects of Bob
                Dylan's career. This is primarily a data analysis and visualization project. The <a
                    href="methods.html" target="blank">methods page</a> will focus on how and where
                I retrieved data from and the <a href="viz.html" target="blank">visualization
                    page</a> will focus on the results and findings of my data analysis. If you
                would like to know more about me,check out my <a href="about.html" target="blank"
                    >about me page</a>. The project primarily focuses on Dylan's original albums.
                For this project,I categorize an original album as an album that consists primarily
                of songs that were written by Dylan himself.Primarily we will be discussing his
                original albums. Overall,there are 33 original albums and a total of 48 live or
                compilation albums. I consider albums that are covers such as Shadows of the Night
                as compilation albums.Additionally,I also make a distinction from his early years
                and late years. I define his early years from 1962-1980 and his late years from
                1980-2020. Although this may seem uneven,there are 17 original albums from his early
                years and 16 from his late years.</p>

                <h2>My Questions</h2>
                <p>There are a few questions that I plan on answering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is Dylan's production rate over the years?Has he released more original
                        albums during his earlier or later years?</li>
                    <li>What themes does he mention most in songs?</li>
                    <li>How many different genres does he dabble in?Does he mostly stick with one
                        genre?</li>
                    <li>How many songs has he written?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Findings</h2>
                <p>After analyzing my data,I've learned a lot about Bob Dylan and his career. I
                    analyzed data about instruments played,tracks,verses,genres,album types. These
                    findings can be found on <a href="albumType.html">album
                    type</a>.Additionally,since Dylan's career is multi-generational, I've also
                    analyzed data about his media formats which can be found on the <a
