            <h1>Bob Dylan Analysis</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Bob Dylan Analysis! On this site we will explore various aspects of Bob
                Dylan's career. This is primarily a data analysis and visualization project. The <a
                    href="methods.html" target="blank">methods page</a> will focus on how and where
                I retrieved data and the visualization pages(AlbumTypes and Media Formats) will
                address the results and findings of my data analysis. If you would like to know more
                about me,check out my <a href="about.html" target="blank">about me page</a>.</p>
            <p>This project primarily proritizes Dylan's <dfn>original</dfn> albums. I categorize an
                original album as an album that consists primarily of songs that were written by
                Dylan himself.This is same terminology as "Studio albums" on the <a
                    href="https://bobdylan.fandom.com/wiki/Discography" target="blank">Bob Dylan
                    Fandom Wiki</a> which was a very important source for this project.
                Overall,there are 33 original albums and a total of 48 live or <dfn> compilation
                    albums</dfn>. I consider albums that are covers such as Shadows of the Night or
                ones that are mostly previously recorded songs as compilation albums. Additionally,I  make a distinction
                from his early years and late years. Based on my analysis,I define his early years from 1962-1980 and his
                late years from 1980-2020. He produced  17 original
                albums in the first 18 years of his career-representing his early years and 16 albums in his late years. </p>

                <h2>My Questions</h2>
                <p>There are a few questions that I plan on answering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is Dylan's production rate over the years?Has he released more original
                        albums during his earlier or later years?</li>
                    <li>What instruments does he primarily use?</li>
                    <li>How many different genres does he dabble in? Does he mostly stick with one
                        genre?</li>
                    <li>How many formats has he released music on?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Findings</h2>
                <p>After analyzing my data,I've learned a lot about Bob Dylan and his career. I
                    analyzed data about instruments played,tracks,verses,genres and album types.Over
                    the year, he his top three most frequently used instruments were the same across
                    both periods.The most suprising thing I learned about his instrumentation was
                    that he does not use a harmonica in all of his albums.He also uses less
                    instruments in his late years. Dylan gets more experimental over the years and
                    explores more genres in the later part of his career. He created music that
                    explored 15 different genres that included jazz,R&amp;B,funk and many more.His
                    most frequent genres are also consistent among both periods. Over the years,he
                    is consistent in number of verses but has a increases his average song length
                    over time.However,he decreases his average track count per album. In terms of
                    album types,he releases more compilation and live albums. This explains why he
                    has a lower amount of original content produced.Lastly,he increases the amount
                    of format types he releases his albums on from 3 to 5. </p>
