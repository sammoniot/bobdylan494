            <p>Welcome to my Album Types page! Here we will explore the different types of albums
                Dylan has released over the years as well as specific information about his albums.
                We will analyze data regarding tracks,genres and more! </p>

                <div class="power">
                    <p> These visualizations explore the rate of production over the years and what
                        types of album Dylan released. </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img id="trackmap" src="images/albuminfo/albumntrack.png"
                            alt="tree map displaying the average track count per album type." />
                        <figcaption>This tree map analyzes the average number of track counts per
                            album type,categorized by period. </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>As the tree map shows,the og albums have the lowest number of tracks among
                        both periods. The average number of track count of the live and
                        comp(compilation) albums among the late Dylan period are higher than the
                        early Dylan period.This could be because the live and comp albums for the
                        late Dylan period also included music from the early Dylan period as
                        well.Wheras all the songs in the live and comp albums in the early Dylan
                        period are restricted to just music that was released during that period. </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img id="donut" src="images/albuminfo/totaltrackcount.png"
                            alt="donut graph displaying the total amount of tracks per period" />
                        <figcaption>This donut graph analyzes the sum of the total number of tracks
                            released by period.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The data shows that the late Dylan period had a significantly higher number
                        of tracks released. The previos tree map showed that there was a higher
                        average of tracks in the late period as well.The higher number of live and
                        comp tracks are most likely contributing factors to why the number is so
                        much higher than the early period.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img id="live" src="images/albuminfo/livencomp.png"
                            alt="funnel graph that compares number of live and compilation albums" />
                        <figcaption>This funnel graph displays how many live and comp albums Dylan
                            released over his entire career.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The data shows that Dylan released more comp albums than live albums.This is
                        most likely because it is generally easier to produce comp albums than live
                        albums. Comp albums are made by taking already existing materrial and
                        compiling the works together.The live albums require more logistics such as
                        talent availiability that could make the production of live albums more
                        difficult than comp albums.</p>
