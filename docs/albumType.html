            <h1>Album Types</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Album Types page! Here we will explore the different types of albums
                Dylan has released over the years as well as specific information about his albums.
                We will analyze data regarding tracks,genres and more! </p>

                    <p> These visualizations explore the rate of production over the years and what
                        types of album Dylan released. </p>

                        <figcaption>This tree map analyzes the average number of track counts per
                            album type,categorized by period. </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>As the tree map shows,the og albums have the lowest number of tracks among
                        both periods. The average number of track count of the live and
                        comp(compilation) albums among the late Dylan period are higher than the
                        early Dylan period.This could be because the live and comp albums for the
                        late Dylan period also included music from the early Dylan period as
                        well.Wheras all the songs in the live and comp albums in the early Dylan
                        period are restricted to just music that was released during that period. </p>

                        <figcaption>This treemap analyzes the top 3 instruments that Dylan used over
                            his entire career. This data includes all 33 original albums. He stays
                            consistent in which instruments he uses. </figcaption>

                        <figcaption>This donut graph analyzes the sum of the total number of tracks
                            released by period.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The data shows that the late Dylan period had a significantly higher number
                        of tracks released. The previos tree map showed that there was a higher
                        average of tracks in the late period as well.The higher number of live and
                        comp tracks are most likely contributing factors to why the number is so
                        much higher than the early period.</p>

                        <figcaption>This funnel graph displays how many live and comp albums Dylan
                            released over his entire career.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The data shows that Dylan released more comp albums than live albums.This is
                        most likely because it is generally easier to produce comp albums than live
                        albums. Comp albums are made by taking already existing materrial and
                        compiling the works together.The live albums require more logistics such as
                        talent availiability that could make the production of live albums more
                        difficult than comp albums.</p>

                <h2>SVGs</h2>
                <p>Early on in the project,I collected txt files from eight of Dylan's albums. Four
                    are from his early years(The Freewhiln' Bob Dylan ,Highway 61 Revisited,Blood on
                    the Tracks,Slow Train Coming) and four are from his late years,(Infidels,Empire
                    Burlesque,Time Out of Mind and finally Rough and Rowdy Ways). I chose these
                    albums not only because they are some of my favorite albums of his but because
                    they are representative of his career. The early albums I chose are a similar
                    genres and emphasize his folk and protest music. The late albums I chose
                    represent his experimentation of different genres and music styles. I used
                    AntConc to find the verse frequency among the albums.</p>

                    <p>Dylan is consistent among his entire career in verses.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Dylan's average song length increases by almost one minute. Over the years he
                        gets more experimental and makes longer pieces. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Over the years,Dylan is consistent about what genres his albums are. At least
                        half of his original albums are considered either folk,folk rock or
                        both.</p>
