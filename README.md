# bobdylan494
Welcome to my Bob Dylan Digit 494 senior project! My goal with this project is to analyze patterns and trends among  Bob Dylan's career and how they may have changed over the years.The primary focus is on his original albums but I include some data about his live and compilation albums. On this site,I explore topics such as genre,instrumentation,album types,formats and more. Data visualization and cleaning data are crucial to this project.My goals was to create  diverse types of data visualization such as funnel graphs,treemaps and more. I got my data from Genius,AntConc and Bob Dylan Wiki. I have cleaned a [csv](https://github.com/sammoniot/bobdylan494/blob/main/data/fulldata.csv) and [xslsx](https://github.com/sammoniot/bobdylan494/blob/main/data/fulldata.xlsx) file which you may download. Additionally,I have analyzed some of Dylan's most popular albums and did some research on their song length and verse counts.The albums I analyzed are: The Freewhiln' Bob Dylan (1963),Highway 61 Revisited(1965),Blood on the Tracks (1975),Slow Train Coming (1979),Infidels(1983),Empire Burlesque(1985),Time Out of Mind(1997) and finally Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020).
