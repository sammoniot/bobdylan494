# bobdylan494
Welcome to my Bob Dylan Digit 494 senior project! My goal with this project is to analyze patterns and trends among various Bob Dylan albums and how they may have changed over the years. The albums I will be analyzing are: The Freewhiln' Bob Dylan (1963),Highway 61 Revisited(1965),Blood on the Tracks (1975),Slow Train Coming (1979),Infidels(1983),Empire Burlesque(1985),Time Out of Mind(1997) and finally Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). I will create and explore various forms of data visualizations to analyze Dylan's patterns and trends. I will be advised throughout the semester by Dr. Beshero-Bondar and I hope to complete this project by May 2025.
